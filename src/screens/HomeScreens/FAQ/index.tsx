            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            Personal safety is a human right and should be accessible to
            everyone, so Rove is completely free and will always remain so.

              How does Rove protect me?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            Whenever you are on the move, Rove monitors for signs of distress
            and triggers an alert to your trusted contacts - including live
            location and audio stream - in case of an assault. This means you
            don’t need to manually trigger the app and your loved ones are
            always able to react and call for help if the worst should happen.
            {'\n\n'}
            <CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
              Why not simply call 911?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            Rove should not be seen as a replacement for regular emergency
            services but as a companion who is able to look out for you in
            situations where you are unable to make the call yourself.

              How do I activate an emergency stream manually?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            You can always start the live video stream directly from the app,
            which will be shared with your trusted contacts including your live
            location. If you are not able to (or comfortable) using the video
            stream, you can always trigger Rove’s audio stream and live location
            by using your safe word, which you set up in the app.

            <CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
              How many contacts can I share my location with?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            You can share your live stream with up to five trusted contacts.

              Can Rove accidentally start an audio stream?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            In certain scenarios like combat training or role-playing, the app
            might rarely misinterpret behavior and trigger an alert. While we
            are working to refine this, we suggest you add locations where such
            actions may occur to your SAFE ZONES.

              How do I know if Rove is audio streaming?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            If Rove is triggered, you will see a generic popup message saying
            that Rove is active.
            {'\n\n'}
            <CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
              How do I stop a stream if Rove is triggered?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            You will be able to enter a pin that you create at the time of
            sign-up, and it will only be available to you so that you can stop
            the stream.

              What if I don’t have coverage?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            If you don’t have coverage, Rove will not be able to trigger a
            stream and can only record locally. The video and/or audio will then
            automatically be shared with your trusted contacts as soon as your
            phone reconnects to a network.
            {'\n\n'}

              Does Rove work at home?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            Rove is a public safety app that monitors your safety when you are
            on the move and outside of your SAFE ZONES.
            {'\n\n'}
            <CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
              Is Rove always listening to me?{'\n'}
            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            Rove does not store the data it processes, but instead scans for
            patterns. For added privacy, a manual, streaming-only option is
            available.

            We do not expect that a TV or computer will trigger a stream.

            </CustomText.LargeSemiBoldText>
            Your personal information and data are protected using end-to-end
            encryption. This ensures that your data is accessible only to you
            and your designated contacts and can be shared by them with
            emergency services if necessary.
